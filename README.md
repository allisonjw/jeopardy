## Objective
  
  For this project we will solidify our understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles by building out a game show. This is an opportunity to work with classes to build a program at a larger scale than with previous projects. This is also an opportunity for us to build out a program based on user stories - which is more aligned to what we can expect to see working with product managers in a production environment.

## Tools Used

- JavaScript
- Jquery
- HTML
- CSS (SCSS/SASS)
- herokuapp API
- eslint
- webpack

## Requirements

You must have node and npm installed on your local machine. This is used to install all of the dependencies of the application. To install these packages, just intall node, which includes an installation of npm.

```bash
brew install node
```
